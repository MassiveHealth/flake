Flake is an implementation of Twitter's Snowflake in Tornado. "Snowflake is a network service for generating unique ID numbers at high scale with some simple guarantees."

@see http://github.com/twitter/snowflake

Usage:
./flake.py --worker_id=N

Where worker_id N is a globally unique integer between 0 and 1023. 

Example supervisord conf for a two core machine:

[program:flake]
command=/var/www/flake/flake.py --logging=warning --worker_id=%(process_num)d --port=80%(process_num)02d
process_name=%(program_name)s%(process_num)d
numprocs=2
numprocs_start=0 ; be sure to set this offest such that worker_id is unique across all machines in your Flake cluster
autostart=true
